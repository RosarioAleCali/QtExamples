# Simple Video Converter
Simple Video Converter allows users to convert videos into the **.AVI**, **.MP4**, and **.MOV Formats**.

This is acomplished by using **FFmpeg** and a **QProcess**.</br>
**QProcess** will take care of starting a **new FFmpeg process** and communicate with it.</br>
Thanks to the QProcess we will know when the process starts, ends, and what happens while the process is running.</br>
This application uses FFmpeg to simply convert a file video from one format to another keeping the original resolution.
