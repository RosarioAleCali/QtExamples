# OS Login Screen
OS Login Screen is a simple mock-up program for the login interface of a Desktop OS.

In this small program I have learned about the following:
* Use a picture as a background picture.
* Use images for push buttons.
* Change the color of the Buttons based on the mouse events.
* Use CSS Stylesheets within Qt.
* Use QLabels.
* Use QLineEdit, also for Passwords.
* Horizontal/Vertical Layouts.
* Horizontal/Vertical Spacers.
