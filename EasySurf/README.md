# EasySurf
EasySurf is a very simple Web Browser based on the **WebEngine API** which is based on the Google's Chromium engine.</br>

The implementation of the browser is very simple therefore it allows users to do very simple things such as loading one
page at the time, going back and forth, and running Javascript Code. The following screenshots will give you a 
better idea of what the browser can do.
