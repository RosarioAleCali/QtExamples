# QtExamples

## Intorduction
This is a small collection of programs, mostly written in C++, using the Qt Framework.
The programs include, but are not limited to, the following Qt Topics:
* States and Animations
* QPainter and 2D Graphics
* Using OpenGL within Qt
* XML Parsing
* Using FFmpeg within Qt
* Using MySql within Qt
* Qt WebEngine

Please read the description and/or the README.md file of each sub-project to find out what each project is about.

## System Requirements
To successfully compile and run these code examples using the project file provided you will need:
* Qt Creator 4.3.x
* Qt Framework 5.9.x
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

By default my code examples were compiled using 64-bit compilers.

However, the code examples will also run on older versions of the Qt Framework and different compilers but you may need to modify the
project file (.pro) to work with your toolchain.

## Notice
These code exemples are not to be considered as products to be used in a real life day-to-day scenario.
They are rather to be considered for learning purposes only and to showcase my knowledge of the Qt Framework.
