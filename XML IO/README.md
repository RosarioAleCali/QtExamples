# XML IO
XML IO is a simple program that reads data from an XML file and writes defaulted data to an XML File.
In this program I use the **stream reader** and **stream writer** classes to read data from and to XML Files.
Once we read from the XML File the extracted data will be displayed on the debug console window.
